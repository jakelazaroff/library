# web components

A small collection of web components I've reused for different projects.

- [`<click-outside>`](/click-outside.js): a component that detects when when mouse and pointer events are triggered outside of it.
- [`<roving-tabindex>`](/roving-tabindex.js): a component that implements the [roving tabindex](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/keyboard-interface/#kbd_roving_tabindex) pattern for building accessible menus and grids.
